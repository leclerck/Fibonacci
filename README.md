
# Fibonacci Sequence

The program asks the user to enter an integer n between 1 and 46 and prints the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence
```sh
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...
```

where  F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2, F(4) = 3, F(n) = F(n-1) + F (n-2).
If n=7, the output would be
```sh
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
```
With any other input the program will show an error message.
